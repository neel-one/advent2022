Excited to share my Advent of Code 2022 solutions.

Disclaimer: this code is not a reflection of my personal ability in terms of style, variable names, etc. Much of this work is done with quick completion in mind and with a disregard for best practices.

Most earlier days will solve day 2 (as I deleted the day 1 relevant code). Later days will keep both parts.

~~So far, I have been able to reasonably solve all problems except for Day 16 Part 2 where I (think) my bug is in that I can't figure out a correct heuristic and am getting a solution that is 11 pressure too low (2100 vs 2111). I might rewrite the DFS w/ backtracking to use BFS with pruning (it seemed to work well for Day 19).~~

Update: Re-did day 16 from scratch, and was able to fix my solution in 16correct.py
